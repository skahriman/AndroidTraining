Week 3 Daily 4(SERVICES)

2. Create an IntentService to create a list of random objects (The objects should 	 have atleast 4 fields including an image). Populate the recyclerView in the same	activity which starts the intent service. Pass the data using a broadcast 		   receiver.
3. Use the AlarmManager(Btn1) and JobScheduler(Btn2) to send a notification after 	 30 secs on clicking each list item. The notification should have the object 	   information that was clicked on.
