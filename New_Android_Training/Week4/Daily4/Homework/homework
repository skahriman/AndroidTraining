 Senior   Engineer   Technical   Exercise   -   Android
Build   an   application   that   displays   recipe   search   results.   The   application   will   let   the   user   input   a   search term   and   retrieve   a   list   of   recipes.   Display   the   recipe   results   in   a   scrollable   grid   of   images.   Clicking   on   an image   will   go   to   a   new   screen   that   shows:   the   recipe   image,   recipe   name,   ingredients   list,   source,   and source   link.   The   user   can   click   on   the   source   link   to   leave   the   app   and   navigate   to   the   source   webpage   or select   back   to   return   to   their   search   results.
